# Complete Javascript Course 2021

Included in this repo will be the completed coding challenges that can be found in the [all-coding-challenges](all-coding-challenges.pdf) PDF as part of the Complete Javascript Course that I am currently working through (as of Sept 2021) from Udemy. 

The coding challenges will be split into folders relevant to the section of the course. e.g. Fundamentals Part 1 folder will have a file for each of it's coding challenges and Data Structures, Modern Operators and Strings folder will have a file for each of it's coding challenges.
